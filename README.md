 Project Description/Outline:
 	Our group will analyze several key metrics of various National Basketball Association (NBA) players. The key metrics that we will analyze will be a specific playerâ€™s height, their wingspan, and their free-throw percentage over a given season/career. From these key metrics we will create a ratio that will be applied to the historical best and worst free throw shooters.
         	Our group will also utilize box plots within our regression model to determine any outliers or anomalies when calculating the ratios of current NBA players.
         	Limitations have been put in place to filter out extreme anomalies including: **Minimum of 82 free throws attempted in a NBA season.**
 Research Questions to Answer:
         	To determine if there is a correlation between height, wingspan, and successful free throw attempts.
